# Code of Conduct

DiffGuard is a practical security-minded open source project. We keep things professional, direct, and bias-free. Participate with the same standards you would apply in a well-run engineering team.

## Ground Rules
- Be respectful and constructive. Critique code, not people.
- Assume good intent; ask for clarification before escalating.
- Keep discussions focused on technical merit, security, and maintainability.
- No harassment, discrimination, personal attacks, or off-topic political debates.
- No spam, self-promotion, or intentionally misleading information.
- Protect sensitive information: do not post secrets, tokens, or proprietary data.

## Reporting
If something crosses a line, open a private issue or email the maintainers (see `SECURITY.md` for contact guidance). Provide:
- What happened (facts, not speculation)
- Links or copies of relevant context
- Your requested outcome (if any)

Reports will be reviewed promptly. Repeated or serious violations may result in warnings, PR/issue locks, or removal from the project spaces.

## Enforcement
Maintainers have discretion to:
1. Clarify expectations
2. Issue a private or public warning
3. Remove or edit content (with explanation)
4. Temporarily or permanently restrict participation

Appeals can be raised respectfully if you believe an action was taken in error.

## Scope
This applies to all project spaces: GitHub issues, PRs, code review comments, discussions, and any synchronous communication hosted for the project.

Stay focused. Build useful security tooling. Help others do the same.
